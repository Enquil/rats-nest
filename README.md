# The Rats Nest

## Early draft

Welcome to the Rats Nest, a health and fitness shop bringing all you need to get fit right to your doorstep.
This is a failed attempt, after having some health issues since right before my P4 was going to be turned in,
and after speaking to Student Care about resubmissions and reading the criterias one more time, i decided to start with a new project because failure was inevitable.
My first project was going to be the bookshop le-livre which has a repo here on my github, but that was slowly turning into a copy of the walkthrough project, not good.
Extension seemed hard to get because of some external reasons, so after talking to Student Care i decided to just put a list here of intended features for this new project instead.

### A health and fitness shop

#### Webshop will contain at least the following things:

* 4 MAIN categories of products: Nutrition, Weights/Gear, Clothing and Devices (Electronic and otherwise), these will possibly be contained within separate tables.
* The above will most likely be split into different models to some extent to give me the opportunity to work with abstract inheritance classes.
* Product system with inheritance classes (Ideally)
* User account functionality with profiles where one can make personal customization etc.
* Product rating system with option to leave reviews
* Option to subscribe to a newsletter
* Membership perks, likely in the form of special offers
* Order History
* Preferably a subscription model for something, if i can make it fit the store theme
* All the "not-so-modular" requirements like good SEO, a facebook page etc.
